Base (Vinny's Laptop Plugged In):
    Copy Sheet = 10.137s
    Rename Sheet = 2.364s
    Copy Cells = 11.157s
    Move Cells = 10.947s
    Load Workbook = 10.156s

Currently only Copy Sheet and Rename Sheet (no cellrefs) is behind the
performance requirement. The Rename Sheet test happens to have no cellrefs
(by its flawed design when it was first made) but this means it matches the
test that is currently failing.

Attempt 1
    Theory-The Rename Sheet has unnecessary calls to the parser to replace the
        old sheet name as none of the cells have the old name. Thus, adding
        a condition to find the old name in the contents then call the parser
        should lower the runtime.
    Rationale-The profiler indicates that there was a call to parser for every
        cell that had a direct reference to a cell in the sheet.
    Outcome-After making the necessary changes, the Rename Sheet test is much
        faster.

    Copy Sheet = 10.400s
    Rename Sheet = 0.002s
    Copy Cells = 10.443s
    Move Cells = 9.730s
    Load Workbook = 10.705s

Attempt 2
    Theory-The Copy Sheet has many calls to update_cell which isn't necessary
        copying cells whose values have been already updated. Any update
        should come from cells referencing this new sheet.
    Rationale-The profiler indicates that the largest hotspot were from many
        calls to update_cell.
    Outcome-After making the necessary changes, the Copy Sheet test is much
        faster.

    Copy Sheet = 2.197s
    Rename Sheet = 0.002s
    Copy Cells = 10.869s
    Move Cells = 10.455s
    Load Workbook = 10.504s
